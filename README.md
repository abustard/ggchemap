Tools for Creating Common Geochemical Maps Using ggplot2

This project aims to create ggplot2 extensions to assist in the production of common geochemical maps. The first such tool is a stat for interpolating irregularly spaced data using inverse distance weighting (stat_IDW, StatIDW). Future stats will include contouring options for the interpolated data, and a point bassed stat for automatically binning z values by percentiles (continous chemical data to binned factors).
